# dungeon_world_npc_maker
A simple CLI-driven NPC generator for Dungeon World using Node.js

### Requirements:

You must have Node.js installed (I recommend using the latest LTS version) as well as access to a command line or terminal. Mac and Linux users already have a terminal built-in to their respective OSes. Windows users have several different options available such as Powershell, Git Bash, Windows Subsystem for Linux (Windows 10 only), the Windows command prompt, or even the terminal within VS Code.

### Usage instructions:

Simply clone/download the repo and unzip it. Open up your terminal/command line etc and navigate to the directory that contains the unzipped folder. Once there, run the following command:

`node npc.js`

The console should output two lines of text, one being an Instinct and the other being a Knack. Both are randomly selected from their respective tables so there's 10,000 distinct combinations to create unique and flavorful NPCs for your Dungeon World (or other fantasy based) campaign. Once you have an Instinct and a Knack you have a framework upon which you can build and flesh out your NPC as per the suggestions in the Dungeon World core rulebook (see pages 390-393). You can execute the command as many times as you wish and you'll get a distinct and unique combination each and every time. Enjoy!
